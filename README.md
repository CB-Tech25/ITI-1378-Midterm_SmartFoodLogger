Smart Food Logger: Image-Based Meal Classification
Team member: Lakwan Bonsu & Courtney Bernard
Course: ITAI 1378 - Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence
Project tier: Tier 2 - uses a pretrained computer vision model and a public dataset, with planned fine-tuning or evaluation on a scoped subset of Food-101.
Problem Statement
Many people who want to eat healthier or keep track of their nutrition struggle to log every meal consistently. Manually searching for foods and entering meals can be time-consuming, so people often forget to log their meals or stop tracking altogether. This can make it harder to monitor eating habits and reach health or fitness goals.
Solution Overview
Our Smart Food Logger uses an image classification model to recognize food from a photo and automatically create a meal log. This makes meal tracking quicker and easier, and more convenient for users.
Input Food Image -> Image Preprocessing -> Food Classification Model -> Predicted Food Label -> Meal Log Output
Technical Approach
Computer vision task: image classification.
Primary model: `eslamxm/vit-base-food101`, a Vision Transformer model fine-tuned for Food-101 image classification.
Backup model options:
`dwililiya/food101-model-classification` - EfficientNet-B0 model for Food-101.
`onnx-community/swin-finetuned-food101-ONNX` - ONNX Swin Transformer option for faster inference or dependency issues.
Frameworks:
PyTorch
Hugging Face Transformers
Hugging Face Datasets
PIL/Pillow for image handling
Gradio for an optional demo interface
The reason for using image classification is that the goal is to identify the food category from a single photo. A pretrained Food-101 model keeps the project feasible because training a model from scratch would require more compute and time than the course project allows.
Dataset Plan
Dataset: `ethz/food101` from Hugging Face Datasets.
Source: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ethz/food101
Dataset details:
101 food categories
About 101,000 images total
750 training images per class
250 test/validation images per class
Labels are food category names such as pizza, ramen, hamburger, apple pie, and sushi
Scope plan:
Start with the full dataset for baseline evaluation.
If compute is slow, reduce the project to a 10-20 class subset.
Use basic preprocessing: resize images, normalize pixel values, and apply light augmentation if fine-tuning.
Success Metrics
Primary metric:
Top-1 classification accuracy target: at least 85 percent on the selected evaluation set.
Secondary metrics:
Inference time target: under 2 seconds per image on Google Colab.
Demo usability: upload one image and receive a readable food label without manual steps.
Week-by-Week Plan
Week	Task	Milestone

2	Load pretrained model and run baseline inference on sample images	Model working
3	Evaluate model on a small test subset and optionally fine-tune 10-20 classes	Baseline metrics recorded
4	Improve results with preprocessing, augmentation, or model swap if needed	Accuracy improved
5	Build a simple demo with Gradio or a Colab widget	Demo ready
6	Final testing, documentation, slides, and AI usage log	Repo and proposal complete
7	Present project in class	Presentation complete
Resources Needed
Compute:
Google Colab free tier
Backup: Kaggle GPU notebook
Software:
Python 3.10+
PyTorch
Hugging Face Transformers
Hugging Face Datasets
Pillow
Gradio
Estimated cost:
$0 using free compute and public datasets.
Risks and Mitigation
Risk	Probability	Mitigation
Accuracy is lower than expected	Medium	Evaluate another pretrained model, add augmentation, or reduce to a cleaner 10-20 class subset
Colab is too slow or crashes	Medium	Reduce dataset size, use batch inference, or switch to Kaggle GPU
Model dependency errors	Medium	Use the EfficientNet backup model or ONNX Swin model
Calorie estimates are unreliable	High	Keep calorie output as a simple demo feature and make classification accuracy the main project goal
Food images contain multiple dishes	Medium	Limit demo to single-dish images and document this limitation
